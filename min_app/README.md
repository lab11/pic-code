# Minimum Blink Application

In order to facilitate explorations in position independent code, a tiny source
file capable of producing a visible result is necessary. This is a single C
file capable of blinking LEDs on cc2538-based systems. Currently, it works with
the Atum [repo](https://github.com/lab11/atum) and SDL
[repo](https://github.com/lab11/torch) platforms.
